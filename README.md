# Online-drug-and-medicine-manufacturing-system

For my Y2S1 OOP project at SLIIT, I am developing an Online Drug and Medicine Manufacturing System focusing on Delivery Management. The system will feature a Delivery Details page with fields for Customer Name, Delivery Address, Delivery Time, and Date. It will also include a Login page and a Registration page. This website will support full CRUD operations for managing deliveries. The project utilizes Java and Java Servlets, running on a Tomcat server, with MySQL as the database. The aim is to provide a seamless and efficient delivery management solution for the online pharmaceutical industry.
